# Handwritten-digit-
This repository is used to classify handwritten numbers using mnits datasets.

# About NMIST
In this case I will use mnist.npz . this is a file containing numpy arrays with keys 'x_train', 'y_train', 'x_test', 'y_test' to store training and testing data.

mnist.npz reduces the size of the original (compressed) MNIST file but retains the information needed for training

# Training model 
After you train the model, we will see the relationship between training and validation loss. The graph shows that the model is not overfitting,

# Accuracy ,  Predict & Actual 
You can see that the accuracy is 97%. ==> meaning the model is working properly and the predicted value will be as close to the actual value as possible.
